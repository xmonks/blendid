[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/topmonks/blendid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/topmonks/blendid)

**Blendid** is a delicious stand-alone blend of tasks and build tools that form a full-featured modern asset pipeline. It can be used as-is as a static site builder, or can be configured and integrated into your own development environment and site or app structure.

## Quick start on a fresh project (empty directory)
```bash
yarn init
yarn add blendid
yarn blendid init
yarn blendid
```

This will create default src and config files in your directory and start compiling and live-updating files! Try editing them and watch your browser auto-update!
